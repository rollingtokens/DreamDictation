## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does DreamDictation require an internet connection?
No. DreamDictation is designed to work offline. Both the Speech Synthesis (TTS) and Character Recognition (OCR) run entirely on your device, ensuring your study sessions can happen anywhere. Note: Syncing progress via iCloud would require an internet connection.

### How accurate is the handwriting recognition?
We use Apple's advanced Vision Framework to recognize handwriting. It works best with clear, legible handwriting and good lighting conditions. While highly accurate, we recommend reviewing the results manually for subtle spelling nuances.

### Can I import my own word lists?
Yes! You can create custom "Units" or "Chapters" and add words manually, or use the "Scan to Import" feature to capture lists directly from your physical textbooks.

### Is my data private?
Absolutely. We do not store your photos, audio recordings, or word lists on our servers. Everything stays on your iPhone. Please refer to our Privacy Policy for more details.

### What languages are supported?
DreamDictation supports multiple languages including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and more, leveraging the native language support of iOS.
